                Use this section to configure which of the Security Schemes are needed in order to invoke operations
                in the API.  You can add multiple security requirements, resulting in consumers being allowed to
                provided <strong>any one</strong> of them.  Each security requirement consists of one or more
                Security Scheme and (in the case of certain security types like OAuth) a list of the scopes the
                consumer must have.
